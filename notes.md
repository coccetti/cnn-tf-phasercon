Let's break down the architecture of the CNN class defined in the code:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture
Convolutional Layer 1 (conv1):

Input Channels: 1 (grayscale image)
Output Channels: 32
Kernel Size: 3x3
Activation Function: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
This layer applies 32 convolutional filters of size 3x3 to the input image, producing 32 feature maps.

Max Pooling Layer 1 (pool):

Kernel Size: 2x2
Stride: 2
This layer downsamples the feature maps by taking the maximum value in each 2x2 window, effectively reducing the spatial dimensions by a factor of 2.

Convolutional Layer 2 (conv2):

Input Channels: 32 (output from the previous layer)
Output Channels: 64
Kernel Size: 3x3
Activation Function: ReLU
This layer applies 64 convolutional filters of size 3x3 to the input feature maps, producing 64 feature maps.

Max Pooling Layer 2 (pool):

Kernel Size: 2x2
Stride: 2
This layer downsamples the feature maps by taking the maximum value in each 2x2 window, effectively reducing the spatial dimensions by a factor of 2.

Flatten Layer (flatten): This layer flattens the 3D feature maps into a 1D vector, preparing it for the fully connected layers.

Fully Connected Layer 1 (fc1):

Input Features: 64 * 30 * 30 (assuming the input image size is 128x128 and after two pooling layers, the size is reduced to 30x30)
Output Features: 64
Activation Function: ReLU
This layer applies a linear transformation to the input vector, producing a 64-dimensional output.

Fully Connected Layer 2 (fc2):

Input Features: 64
Output Features: Number of classes (length of classes list)
This layer applies a linear transformation to the 64-dimensional input, producing an output vector with a length equal to the number of classes. This output is used for classification.

Forward Pass
Input: The input image is passed through the first convolutional layer (conv1), followed by the ReLU activation function.
Pooling: The output is then passed through the first max pooling layer (pool).
Convolution: The pooled output is passed through the second convolutional layer (conv2), followed by the ReLU activation function.
Pooling: The output is then passed through the second max pooling layer (pool).
Flatten: The pooled output is flattened into a 1D vector.
Fully Connected: The flattened vector is passed through the first fully connected layer (fc1), followed by the ReLU activation function.
Output: The output of the first fully connected layer is passed through the second fully connected layer (fc2), producing the final classification output.
This architecture is designed to extract hierarchical features from the input image and use them for classification. The convolutional layers capture spatial features, while the fully connected layers perform the final classification based on the extracted features.
